In 2019 we were invited for a four months residency at the HEM House of contemporary culture, which is located at a former bullet factory on the Hembrug site in Zaandam, The Netherland.

At Het Hem we looked into the history of the former military terrain and forest, the Schokbos (shock forest, from which we took our name) and explored a series of local themes through the parallel narratives of geographic metamorphosis, decolonisation, and institutional change.

At the end of the residency we presented the exhibition No Camouflage. Alongside the exhibition, we organized a series of activities with visitors, former workers of the factory and a youth center with which we engaged with questions around the past, present and future of the building and the surrounding forest.

is a decentralized collective consisting of artists, activists, ecologists, musicians and researchers, who believe in the spiritual and material entanglement of the world, and see creative emancipation in acts of collective thinking, which exceed strict categories and divisions. It is an experiment in presence, open research and improvisation, that
involves opportunities for community engagement, public performance, collective improvisation, and other forms of experiments in radical presence. 


Shock Forest Group consists of seven researchers: Katya Abazajian, Sheryn Akiki, Axel Coumans, Susanna Gonzo, Nicolas Jaar, Daria Kiseleva and Jelger Kroese.

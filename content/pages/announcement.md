title: Three-Week Shock Forest Group Workshop on Radio and Collective Research
  at Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven
---
This November, the Shock Forest Group will be opening its practices to new members and aims to collectively create a five episode radio program, inviting participants to join them in their work at the Van Abbemuseum. The syllabus for the three week workshop uses the Shock Forest Group’s prior work in the Netherlands as a jumping off point for the creation of a new body of sonic work relating to the themes of Cosmic Radio, the group’s project which researches past, present and future of radio in the broadest sense of the word.

No prior education is needed, as there will be workshops where participants will learn how to record, edit and mix the radio episodes, and the creation of the broadcast will be done collectively. 	

The workshop will be held from 13 November-3 December 2023 @ Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven on these dates:

* Wednesday 15 November, 19:00 - 21:00  
* Saturday 18 November, 12:00 - 17:00
* Sunday 19 November 12:00 - 17:00
* Wednesday 22 November, 19:00 - 21:00 
* Saturday 25 November 12:00 - 17:00
* Sunday 26 November 12:00 - 17:00
* Wednesday 29 November, 19:00 - 21:00 
* Saturday 2 November 12:00 - 17:00
* Sunday 3 November 12:00 - 17:00

The final works will be shared through radio broadcasting, publishing and archiving via offline and online mediums.
Shock Forest Group hopes to attract a diverse group of participants that reflect the multitudes of its own collective. A commitment to the full three weekends of workshopping is required.

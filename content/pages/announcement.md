The syllabus for the three-week workshop will revolve around the recurrent themes from their research and guided by the examples from their work. How to engage with material and ghostly traces of the past? How to cultivate a collective sense of trust and safety? How to oppose neoliberal practices, while working within contexts that are shaped by capitalist forces? 

Participants are invited to join a collective learning environment and an open research process to reflect on these questions and explore the past, present and future of radio in the broadest sense of the word, its cosmic and terrestrial forms, military and colonial roots. As well as its potential for practices of listening and story-telling. And as a result to create a new collective compounded composition that will be broadcasted in the form of a radio program.

No prior education is needed, as there will be workshops where participants will learn how to record, edit and mix the radio episodes, and the creation of the broadcast will be done collectively. 

The workshop will be held from **15 November—3 December 2023 at Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven** on the following dates:

* Wednesday 15 November, 19:00 - 21:00 
* Saturday 18 November, 12:30 - 17:30
* Sunday 19 November 12:00 - 17:00
* Wednesday 22 November 19:00 - 21:00
* Saturday 25 November 12:30 - 17:30
* Sunday 26 November 12:00 - 17:00
* Wednesday 29 November, 19:00 - 21:00 
* Saturday 2 December 12:00 - 17:00
* Sunday 3 December 12:00 - 17:00

Shock Forest Group hopes to attract a diverse group of new participants that reflect the multitudes of its own collective. A commitment to the aforementioned dates and times during the full three weekends of workshopping is required. 

Participation in the workshops is **free of charge.** The workshops are **limited to 15 participants.** 

**Application deadline is October 27 at 8PM CET**. Selected participants will be contacted before November 3rd.\

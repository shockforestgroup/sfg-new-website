when the wooden platform is on our ground level, the sound would then be buried, waiting to be excavated or closely listened to – echoing our exhumation and search for intimacy with a seemingly insentient or defunct plane

if the wooden platform is elevated, what would that separation mean?

is it built to distance or to shelter?

we might find ourselves looking upwards rather than ahead, soil beneath our feet, slowly turning into mud with every visitor bringing in the rain with them

immersed in distant sound, some vibrations felt from above, some vibrations could be buried in the soil beneath our feet - could that then mimic a field of protection yet entrapment, a quietly loud landscape that we tread on carefully, inviting us to roam through but not to be one with it, urging us to seek the other side?

why don't we climb up? rest in elevation?

become one with the floor beneath us?

the dampness of the soil seeping through the wood?

the sounds of sounds?

the forest together with its elements, smells, and sounds is out of place here, out of its being, its ground, and its breath

what about us?

are we matter out of place too? dirt?

aren’t we all?

if we all are, in a way or another, matter(s) out of place,

are we then in place?

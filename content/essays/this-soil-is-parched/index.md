title: this soil is parched

on an artificial stage,

on this migrant soil,

it is raining air



8000 sq. meters of air sold

8000 sq. meters of air sold

8000 sq. meters of air sold



off the beaten path,

a hedera helix rises

Its vines have the power to break old concrete

climbing up while slowly engraving the walls,

breaking them bit,

by bit,

by bit,



slow

slow

slow



precarity

precarity

precarity



concrete crumbles,



on this migrant soil, a theatre of war plays out

between secrecy and hands of power, faulty mines explode, human errors divert gazes



,this absence is loud

,this barrier is invisible



the building heard it first

within and without, it still howls

entering from the pipes

traces and traces of our contamination slowly fossilise

their blows gradually disorganise matter



from this earth, stems the incomprehensible,

the intangible,

perpetually



this place feels like it never really existed,

this place on earth wants you to feel like it has hardly stored any time



a virgin territory,

unattainable, transient, detaching you as it detaches itself



it feels uninhabited, a clean slate, but it keeps tying you down in mysterious ways

it ties you down while it uproots its own

instances of contestations are inverted, fed into a bottomless void, fleeting into the unknown



this isn't virgin territory

this isn’t silence



but, how much can we exhume,

if the buried was intangible?

does the past’s echo gets replaced with the replacement of the contaminated soil?



is that sound contaminated?



this concrete home wants to triumph over the constraints of its untamed nature,

it wants to freeze time,



but this empty space is not neutral, its emptiness is disguised,

and its emptiness is even more intrusive



it becomes a shelter for a present being auctioned off,

fading its memories, suppressing its histories, fabulating its temporality,

an empty model into the abyss of its present



but, like the hedera helix slowly making its way upwards,

these spaces begin to breathe, to speak, to scream, to ferment, and to die



the masks of this terrain start to contest

they start to commemorate a disquieting past

their remains are elsewhere

their speech is forgotten

but it can only be that through this

through this fragmentation of meaning that we can strive towards meaning



this land is not a standstill



while we keep stomping over its soil

the buried make themselves heard

this land wants to be a home for the new

but the new always starts with the dead



landless landless deaths turn this place into a living cenotaph



traces of these violences, of these sacrifices, and traces of courage have to emerge to make room for traces of hope



it is raining air,

and this soil is parched

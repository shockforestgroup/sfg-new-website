<!--StartFragment-->

But then water both separates

and joins the fate of your actions

dare to not dissociate and do

not fear, but love one another despite it

together we

aim to create a place of safety that doesnâ€™t

protect by using barriers, but openness and

being inviting, being open to listen.

how solid are the borders between past, present and future?

how solid are the borders between subject and object? Between you and I?

Subject, object a mourning disappearance.

can you find me if you close your eyes?

within and without, unified in emptiness, how do we get full?

drunk futures from the past are here. does it taste as sweet as you thought it would?

Now that the ghost in that bottle has come out?

the contamination becoming volatile.

the mouth, the rot starts to show. slowly

digesting itself, otherness eating itself.

forever forever not knowing how to act in

a place like this. other worlds are here

and you cannot see them. how do we show them to you?

teleportation? telepathy?

A network of brains, neutrons, thoughts bouncing back and forth, pulsing, growing, raising their voices

being heard always ends up with

you belonging

more to the places

we wander.

we should consider owning them less

enjoying them more

what if we could learn from history and the stories we showed

not allowing them to repeat themselves, at last?

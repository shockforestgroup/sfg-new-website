title: When thinking is erasure

The emptiness inside building 429 is full of history. We are used to thinking of art as something that can expose truths, or unveil hidden realities. But what happens when the mantel of 'art space' does the opposite? What if the history of a place gets buried underneath its cultural façade? What if it is modern culture itself that erases history?



When does this happen? When thinking itself is a violent act, when thinking is erasure.



In the context of Dutch institution het Hem, we saw how the environment of thought was one which relied on erasure, where the act of culture-making relied on the erasure of a colonial structure. This colonial structure - the ex-factory itself, the military forest, the bunkers, the factory museum - is deemed to be a national monument which both preserves it and honors it. Culture, when called in to do its sanitizing job and help revitalize the ruin, is complicit if it doesn't try to topple the colonial monument itself, it can either show the monument for what it really is or simply be a conduit for people to spend more time within it. This was our problematic for the three months we spent at het Hem. How do we make any work within a colonial monument? What can grow in a forest built to be bombed?



Vines have taken over the old bunkers in the forest. They stretch through and around them like snakes, leaving their marks on the grey concrete. These vines have the power to topple buildings, especially those made of concrete. The trees in the forest are designated to be monuments - strictly because they were planted for a military purpose - but these vines are not monumental "anything that is outside of the concept is not monumental".



What else is outside the monument?



Countless trees are getting uprooted and trashed because they are contaminated by the soil that houses them. Once they are sent out of the terrain, new trees get put up in their place. These are the newest colonial monuments. Green-washing if you will. The forest continues to be a performance of itself - a theatre no longer for the colonial territories its armaments were ultimately used in, but a theatre of respectability, of 'renewal'. The cultural institution, the trendy restaurant, the artist residency, the new trees: the veil of respectability hides its foundations: which in most of Europe and certainly in the Netherlands is a racist colonial machine, whose motor has not known silence since its inception.



Is anything outside of this monumental machine? This violent structure? Or is this machine the act of white 'thinking' itself?



"It is not only a matter of rethinking using the same procedures and tools for knowing. What is urgently needed is a new approach to thinking itself, one that begins by dissolving the dichotomies (the separations) modern thought has produced to support itself." - Denise Ferreira Da Silva



The interdisciplinary nature of the group had one 'raison d'être' only. To short circuit thinking. To make space for vines. To question all instances of monumentality and the ugliness it hides beneath its 'industrial facade'. We watched as architects, artists, musicians, all kinds of 'creatives' marveled at the space. Seeing the potential -in its suggestive emptiness- before seeing what its potential had already created, namely death, uprooting : the establishment and furthering of white supremacy around the world. The military 'tools' created here are crafted for the imposition of one order on another. Whether it is the Dutch in their colonial missions, or the colonial mission of the Israelis against the Palestinians, or the Turks against the Kurds. These are tools for eradicating knowledge which means they are 'tools for knowing'.



How can we make art in this space without using its own thinking? Without using this thinking that erased knowledge, erased the possibility of thought? The very foundations of this place are filled with death.



"Thinking beyond the limits of the understanding and in aid of (not against) the imagination does not require a flight as far away from the world as possible. \[...] Instead, it demands the opposite move: an attention to the world, to its existents and their elementary constituents. For after all, they are also the basic constituents of everything that is known to exist from here/now to the outer edges of the cosmos, that is, since its inception. \[...] All that exists is also and only a re/de/composition of basic material constituents, which, through uncountable transitions and transmissions, enter in the formation of the world through processes such as calor (heat) and labor (work)." - Denise Ferreira Da Silva



The het Hem institution is Amsterdam/Europe-facing and hides itself from its immediate surroundings, the communities of Poelenburg and Zaandam. In the same way as the factory had done only a decade earlier, where you needed a security clearance in order to enter the terrain, you still need a kind of clearance to feel like you can be part of what's taking place in Hembrug terrain. During our free community bread-making event, which we made free for all Zaankasters, two teenagers from Poelenburg tried entering the cultural institution. I had invited them after spending time with them at a community center in their neighborhood. They were refused entrance by the security guard and only finally let in once they showed them the texts we had exchanged.



We walked around the building, and I gave them a tour of the 'exhibition', unaware of what had transpired. The situation was finally revealed to me once we arrived on the top floor of the building. "This place makes me uncomfortable" said one of the teenagers before telling me the incident.



Thinking beyond the limits of understanding, as Ferreira da Silva says, demands an "attention to the world". The racists security guards, the expensive café, the lack of genuine community outreach all point towards the same whirling machine, the homogenous, comfortable, white understanding of cultural space. An understanding that has been 'monumentalized' by government inside, kept secure by armies outside, and invades the act of thinking itself. We are in a critical moment, where a space for erasure can be filled with life, only with a deep 'attention to the world', to quote Denise Ferreira da Silva, can we finally live in a world where thinking blossoms outside itself.



Erase the names. Het Hem = HH ?

title: The figuring of buoys and swell
author: Axel
---
I could speak of a forest, not from it, Being within a forest, is not to be of it. As foresting is done by forests. And I don’t forest. 
All the same for buoys within waves. They are not of it. Wavebound, yet of something completely other. What can buoys then tell us, if anything, about the waves? 
Waves, ever so forcefully pounding waves, As wind waves are of the wind, These waves are of capitalism, The movement of stuff, forcefully obtained, alienated, gathered, sorted, numbered, sold to the lowest bidder. 
Deployed to transcribe vertical motion Into a lateral humming. Sounding out like a Sirene, Exclusively audible for capitalist programs. Ever echoing into weatherforecasts, steering the locomotor of industry; risk, profit and ETA. 
Waves of wind of a world churning. Waves of capitalism of a world burning. Perhaps these are no waves, these are swells. Waves are linear, swells come in sets. 
Swellbound, a buoy within capitalogenic swell, humming capitalist tunes, Becoming with what lays dormant within. Both sensing and being sensed, situated hyperlocally and part of a large network, depicted in a map, turning into a yellow dot in a blue ocean. a 
Aiding lateral navigation and exploitation, yet exclusively sensing downwards, vertically. 
Anything navigational is rooted in oppression. Aa Buoy has inherited this history unwillingly. That makes us kindred spirits. To get to know the buoy, is to get ourselves bound within a swell, anthropogenic, no, capitalogenic swell. 
Within the North Sea Canal, with the North Sea Canal, A buoy deployed for belonging. A swelling dissonant in a capitalistic matrix. 
First words written after Rolando Hernandes’ contribution to a session of cocreation by mentioning forests and mediation. Elaborated upon after Rolando Hernandes’ teaching of Sonic Meditation: ‘Learning how to fly’. Shared publicly after being presented with a map of the North Sea Canal by Bert Spaan. 
The figuring of buoys and swell 
I could speak of a forest, not from it. Being within a forest, is not to be of it. As foresting is done by forests. And I don’t forest. 
All the same for buoys within waves. They are not of it. Buoys are the wavebound, yet of something completely other. What can buoys then tell us, if anything, about the waves? 
Waves, ever so forcefully pounding waves. As wind waves are of the wind. These waves are of capitalism. The worlding of the movement of matter, forcefully obtained, alienated, gathered, sorted, numbered, sold to the lowest bidder. 
Buoys, deployed to transcribe vertical motion into a lateral humming, sounding out worlds like a Siren, exclusively audible for capitalist programs. Ever echoing into weatherforecasts, steering the locomotor of industry; risk, profit and ETA. 
Waves of wind are of a world churning. Waves of capitalism are of a world burning. Perhaps these are no waves, these are swells. 
Swellbound, a buoy within capitalogenic swell, humming capitalist tunes, becoming-with what lays dormant within. Both sensing and being sensed, situated hyperlocally and part of a large network, depicted in a map, turning into a yellow dot in a blue ocean. Aiding lateral navigation and exploitation, yet exclusively sensing downwards, vertically. Anything navigational is rooted in oppression. A Buoy has inherited this history unwillingly. That makes us kindred spirits. To get to know the buoy, is to get ourselves bound within a capitalogenic swell. 
Within the North Sea Canal, with the North Sea Canal, a buoy is deployed for belonging. A swelling dissonant in a capitalistic matrix.

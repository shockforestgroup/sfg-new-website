When the Artillerie Inrichtingen (AI) first settled at De Hem between 1895 – 1900 there was no forest here. In fact, the Hembrug terrain used to be a (natural) body of water (de Holle Sloot) when in 1876 the Noordzeekanaal was created and the tongue of land De Hem was artificially extended to become this terrain. Its temporary purpose as a dredging depot for peat, clay and sand formed the substrate on which AI placed its factories. About 25 years later, in 1920, it was decided to plant the Shock Forest.


Value of the forest The forest served a purpose. Firstly, to camouflage buildings used for ammunition testing and storage. Secondly, to protect its surroundings from potential explosive damage. The forest was an integral part of the factory, a protective barrier for incoming and outgoing dangers. In 2003, Eurometaal (that emerged from AI) closed. All activities were stopped. The forest lived on. It now still camouflages the old testing and storage facilities. It does not, however, serve its intended purpose as a protective barrier of the factory anymore. 


The Shock Forest as a whole and individual trees within it have received a monumental status (fig. 1). Local political parties and civilian movements stand up for the forest whenever trees are planned to be cut down for urban development or soil remediation. When a ‘valuable’ tree is cut down, it is replaced by a new one. Before 2003, workers used to come into the forest to unwind – and to get shit on by herons. Is it only the functional forest, the part of the factory, that is being conserved? Or is there other value to this forest? Does its value change over time? The forest was planted as a functional object, but it appears to be more than that. It is alive.


Constructing a forest to our design makes us benefit from the properties of that ecosystem. It implies a functional hierarchy between humans and nature; we use it. When the benefits are no longer needed, does the hierarchy remain? Have other values (anthropocentric- or non- anthropocentric) emerged? Do these sustain the hierarchy, or do these bring us from a vertical to a more horizontal relation?


Living archive In 2003, the factory stopped. The forest moved on. All objects in the factories were removed. Destroyed, sold or stored as an archive. The soil and the forest that grows from it also kept a record. Traces of this record can now be found in the form of soil contaminants such as oil, heavy metals and TNT that have been left behind (fig. 2). As such industrial pollution can affect tree growth, we could open the record and consult the yearly tree growth archived in tree rings (fig. 3). How did the industrial activity affect the forest? Were all activities of the factory really stopped?


Preserving an archive When people left the Hembrug terrain, certain objects were kept, buildings were given a monumental status and got renovated. The value in these materials is in more than what it was used for, by who and to what end. There is also a memory attached to it, a sentimental value. Former workers have these experiences stored in them. The forest also has a monumental status and its functional purpose is documented too. For workers or local residents, the forest can also have a sentimental value. But what about the experiences of the forest itself. If we translate the archive of tree rings, can we then speak not about the forest, but from the forest? Other methodologies might also help us document the experiences of the forest. Satellite images (fig. 4) and corresponding remote sensing data (such as photosynthetic fluorescence) 
could show us change in size and leaf cover of the forest over time. Compared to human activities at AI or Eurometaal we could get an idea of how the forest reacted. And how is the forest doing now? We could start archiving the state of the forest, to allow its experiences to be monitored in the future. For example, using LiDAR a 3D rendering of the forest could be made, showing biomass, canopy density and tree height (fig. 5). Later, this can be used to compare and extrapolate the forests experience. When speaking from the forest, the most respectful way of research might be non-invasive: remote sensing. When trees are cut down, taking a tree disk or core sample might not be so bad.


*An example of the forest archive* *– chronodendrology/dendrochronology* From trees that will be cut down, an increment core (or disks) can be extracted (fig. 6). This will result in a number of wooden cores containing the tree rings from birth to death of those trees. Ring-width analysis can be applied to these cores (fig. 3), and the resulting data can be compared to industrial activities. Also, cores from polluted areas can be compared to less- polluted areas to see whether pollution affected tree growth. This way, a spatio-temporal analysis is made that resembles the archive of the forest. The wooden cores can be shown as very precious, important, almost fragile relics. At the same time, the spatio-temporal data is shown in a very modern, dynamic way to emphasize the living character of the trees.


*By the way* Using an intricate research methodology in this case does not necessarily have to uncover any real value, number or correlation, but is used as a way to create a critical perspective. Even ‘unrealistic’ assumptions could be made between activities in the factory/armsdeals and the effect on the forest. Just to make people look differently: what are the effects of these activities or what could they be? How is nature affected by our actions (over time)? With a little effort it could also be used to mirror other recent or global problems such as climate change, illegal logging and forest fires.


*What’s needed* 

* Contamination maps (RVOB 2013). - What trees will be cut down? - Where do cut down trees go? Are there any on the terrain? - Dendrochronological analysis (WUR/RING/private) - LiDAR measurement (WUR/private) - Satellite images and remote sensing data (NASA/ESA/private) - 

*What’s possible* 

* Make an overview of activities at AI/Eurometaal to compare (trees might respond to 
  other things than the ‘big’ cultural activities). -

*“One day or another, it is true, dust, supposing it persists, will probably begin to gain the upper hand over domestics, invading the immense ruins of abandoned buildings, deserted dockyards; and, at that distant epoch, nothing will remain to ward off night-terrors, for lack of which we have become such great book-keepers...”*

*― Georges Bataille, Encyclopaedia Acephalica*



Wetiko, an Algonquin word for the cannibalistic spirit driven by greed, selfishness, excess, consumption – a virus, an epidemic, our invader culture.



Native Americans believed that European colonialists were so chronically infected with Wetiko that it must have been what defined the culture they came from, cannibalising the life-force of all others in the name of progress.



Hasn’t this been the pattern of our histories– the empowered, the global explorations as newer technologies emerge, the domination of our environments?



How can we grow and not just progress?



In our process of tracing back and understanding an ever-so militarised history, will the accumulation of all sociological, geographical, political, economical, and geological data present a unifying moment of understanding?



When we’ve been living in an attention-economy, when freedom and chaos have become so organised and controlled to predict our progress, when our eyes, ears, bodies, and minds have become so blatantly militarised, is our attention the most ‘valuable’, becoming even more profitable, when it is used to re-represent that very same data?



Reality transcends the material world, progress is far more than a question of technomaterial development, and piling on the years does not necessarily mean that we are learning if our vital principles are abandoned.



Maybe it needs to be about a unifying moment of riddance, the dissolution of the past, the activation of our perceptive and sensual foundations to recover and reawaken our relationship with the breathing earth. When was the last time we looked around rather than ahead, listened to the echoes, the cries, and the whispers of our worlds rather than the sound of our clatterings?



Can the dissolution of our data, of our pasts trigger a sense of urgency within us? A need to understand before everything disappears as opposed to a state of jadedness where everything is constantly available, constantly online, constantly traceable?



By dissolving the data we have accumulated, we are noting that our pasts deserve a second chance, a slow and continuous process that frees rather than freezes. That very same data is still present, just taking on a new form– a less intelligible state, disintegrating from the rigid into the fluid while paralleling a natural progress into the unknown.



Maybe that is what we need to learn from nature, how it breeds life, how it can turn destruction into a regenerating force of life, how it can move on while we remain stuck trying to put the pieces together.

When do we cease to be book-keepers and embrace the dust of our pasts?



Is it only when the dust settles, that we can begin again?

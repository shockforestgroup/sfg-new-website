les statues meurent aussi(statues also die) ?



here, on this ground that ceaselessly feels like a survival mechanism on steroids,

where protection melts into corruption, where defence mechanisms become man-made and infra-structured– are we guarding? are we fighting? are we flighting?

what are we even guarding,

fighting,

flighting?

the ghosts of this ground’s past, here, begin to feel very similar to our own, there. the line where past and future meet is getting ever so concrete,

the present quivers uncertainly, the present moves.



are we in a crisis of time, where past and future collide, where dead matter rules,

where the present gets emptied of all its possibilities,

where the present collapses?



there’s something so irresistible in recuperating what power has rejected, what power has side-lined, what power has deemed valueless.



how can we still surprise one another and ourselves, elevate the ignored, overturn society’s expectations, climb out of this power vacuum,

without being invaders ourselves?

how do we speak of violence without being violent ourselves?

how do we not glorify violence? do we cover a wound or reveal it? how do we highlight without colonialising?

how do we revive without death?

how do we remember

from a place we don’t physically remember?



Johny A. Khusyairi speaks of how monuments are no different than mirrors, how monuments are not only bearers of memory, but also sites of struggle over

meaning, how monuments reflect diverse interpretations throughout the time of their presence, for as long as they stand. monuments then also become points of convergence between the official and the alternative remembrance of the past.

monument and memory become inseparable. but are monuments solely memory bearers;

does the space they occupy also become monumental, a guard to memory, or are they transient, symbolic, f i c k l e..?



when a tree, systematically born to withstand ammunition, to mask military functions, to guard violence, and to branch out of contaminated soil becomes monumentalised; what kind of monument becomes of this tree?



the monument here begins to feel like an illegal fate, like a fait accompli; dead matter glorified to what it once was, what it once felt, what used to be but no longer is.



the monument goes missing.



the monument becomes a memory, an idea of, a representation;

the once alive monument becomes interchangeable, but its shade remains.



if that monument occupies another monument, takes up monumental space, stains up monumental space; is it contesting?



does that tree then become a symbol of its forest– a martyr?



what role are we playing by representing that forest, are we inherently representing a man-made shock system, a colonial residue, a violent past, a contaminated present? or are we sympathising with the tree, that it was robbed of its rights, that its raison d’être was snatched from it, that it is residing in split existence?



are all monuments martyrs then, victims of representation, bearers of symbolic speech,

guards of oral history?



that tree transforms into a symbol of memory, of remembrance, of awareness, but what does the tree remember? what pasts does it bring with its presence?

is it happy to be freed, freed from its former roots, freed from its contaminated roots, freed and finally free to be?



is this tree’s death what makes it worth remembering, valuable?

do we only remember when it is too late? what if the tree was still here? is it?

how do we not kill that tree even more, how do we sustain its non-objectifiable depth, how do we not contaminate it even further?



do we shelter it? worship it? caress it? do we memorialize the tree, subject it to daily rituals, repeat that action until it becomes merely symbolic, gestural,,,

until it becomes the words that we need?



what if the tree was still alive? should it be summoned as a witness? to testify? to speak?

isn’t it?

1 Intro

The times of crises not only expose the faults of a current system, but also open up a glimpse of a potential for other possible futures. In the beginning of the pandemic for a brief moment there seemed to be a hopeful feeling of a new beginning. Capitalist mode of production seemed to be suspended, but while its ghosts were roaming the earth, it turned out that the new wave of creative destruction was underway. Very soon it became clear that the old forms of power were getting stronger and instead of stepping into a better future, we are more likely to find ourselves in the past (in reference to the women’s rights, suspension of green policies). Was it a result of an absence of a possible alternative? Can we think about the future without falling into the trap of thinking in terms of progress? Is there after all an alternative to capitalism and progressive future? Should we as accelerationists propose immerse ourselves in social and technological acceleration or instead slow down and ‘clear the head of any further illusions of the future’1? Should we give into the unknown in order to be able to imagine the future ‘after the future of modernity’2, as Franco Bifo Berardi suggests in his book “After the Future”?

Writing this text in the time of a pandemic, subsequent economic crisis, global anti-racism movement and debates around racial discrimination and colonial history, I want to revisit the story of Hembrug terrain/Het Hem (the former munition factory turned into a cultural centre), considering the latest development concerning the future of Het Hem. Following the local lockdown Het Hem had to temporarily close their doors to visitors, lay off staff and suspend their program due to the withdrawal of funding by the main investor. Having initiated a public fundraising campaign they raised enough money to keep their current exhibition in view till the end of the summer, but their future is uncertain.

In the previous text I spoke about the factory being a victim of creative destruction, not having been able to adapt to the new version of capitalism, and efficient violence as a problem of design. In light of the current financial crisis and the precarious future of Het Hem, I want to reflect on a different kind of violence, the violence of capital, the destructive nature of perpetual progress and innovation, the role art and design play in this process, and if there is a way out of the cycle of creative destruction. In this text I will draw a parallel between the history of Hembrug and the transformation of the myth (imagination) of progress and the future throughout the 20th century until today. I want to reflect on the circumstances of the transformation of the factory into a cultural centre and eventually on its current state (mid-Cov19), from 2003 until today.



2 Collapse of the myth of progress



Creative destruction is a driving force of progress and innovation, a force that had eventually brought to the collapse of the factory. It is an essential factor of capitalism as a system that constantly revolutionises the economic structure from within, ceaselessly devaluing existing wealth in order to clear the ground for the creation of the new wealth. The evolution and subsequent obsolescence of technology can be seen as a direct outcome of this process.



Having become a victim of ‘progress’, following the cycle of creative destruction, Hembrug factory closed in 2003, not being able to adapt to the new advanced version of capitalism and warfare, digital, cognitive, bio-genetic and technologically mediated. The collapse and closure of the factory coincided with the economic recession of the early 2000s, and the subsequent crisis of 2008 and was synchronous to the seeming collapse of the trust in the market. Although the ideological bases of neoliberalism have been shaken by the financial crisis, the speculation that capitalism might be on the verge of collapse soon proved to be unfounded. It quickly became clear that far from constituting the end of capitalism, the bank bail-outs were a massive re-assertion of the capitalist realist insistence that there is no alternative.3 Due to the lack of an alternative, neoliberalism having become a ghost of itself, carried on.



That is also around the time when Hembrug reinvented itself. Having been left abandoned for years since its closure, the site was bought in 2011 by the Government Real Estate Agency, which decided to revive the site as ‘a business park for creative and innovative entrepreneurs’4 and eventually transform into a mixed living and working environment. Following the profit, the site reemerged on the market. The former military factory (more specifically building 429) has reinvented itself as a home of culture, presumably completing its metamorphosis, preparing the area for the next stage of gentrification. Today in the midst of the uncertainty, the future of Het Hem as a cultural centre is at risk again. Having lost their main source of funding, it is unclear if they would be able to continue their program. Creative destruction of the capital has reached Het Hem. Before the Covid19 crisis a funding scheme based on a luxury hotel built by OMA Architects in a freshly gentrified area close to Amsterdam seemed to be a certain guarantee of financial stability for Het Hem. But the current crisis showed that the only certain is capital itself, i.e. profit, everything else or everyone else can be destroyed in the process. The crisis revealed that everybody could be in a precarious situation, that nobody is protected from the creative destruction in action.



The current state of ‘capitalist realism’ described by Mark Fisher is based on the ‘widespread sense that not only is capitalism the only viable political and economic system, but also that it is now impossible even to imagine a coherent alternative to it”.5 The widespread effects of neoliberal ideology have lead to the structuring of the reality on the model of economic competition, turning the ‘invisible hand’ of the market into an instrument of ‘objective truth and justice’. So pervasive has neoliberalism become that we seldom even recognise it as an ideology.6 We appear to accept it as a neutral force, a kind of biological law, like Darwin’s theory of evolution. There is a growing understanding that the economic system is too complex for a human to understand, which eventually led to the condition where we have become spectators of an economy increasingly detached from the human scale. “Financial capitalism has obtained autonomy from social life. Recovery of the financial process of valorisation of capital is totally separated from the cycle of material production and social demand. The process of decision-making and projecting a future in which one future among many is selected depends less and less on human will”.7



3 Collapse of the myth of the future



For a long time the future was imagined in parallel with the metaphors of progress. According to Franco Bifo Berardi, “the rise of the myth of the future is rooted in modern capitalism, in the experience of expansion of economy and knowledge”.8 He argues that the future is a cultural construct, that the idea that the future will be better than the present is not a natural one, but can rather be attributed to the expansive pursuit of surplus value of the capitalist mode of production. And … attributes the rise of the myth of the future to the beginning of the colonial era, when the future became a spacial idea of expansion and growth.9



Having begun with a ‘Futurist Manifesto’, the 20th century is often described as ‘the century that trusted in the future’. The history of Hembrug munition factory also lasted for the entire 20th century, transforming and adapting to the changing reality. The history of the factory existed in parallel to the transformation of the enthusiasm towards industrialisation and automation of the early 20th century, but also to the deterioration of the trust in the future, and the change of its perception from utopia to dystopia. The transformation of the trust in the future was synchronous with the transformation of capitalism, labour and warfare, from industrial to digital, cognitive, semio, bio-genetic, technologically-mediated.



Today there is a pervasive feeling of the end of trust in the future, the age of economic, geographic and cultural expansion seems to be over. “The future becomes a threat when the collective imagination becomes incapable of seeing possible alternatives to trends leading to devastation, increased poverty and violence. This is precisely our current situation, because capitalism has become a system of techno-economic automatisms that politics cannot evade.”10 The future doesn’t appear to be an object of choice and of a collective conscious action, but as an inevitable catastrophe. The imagination of the future transformed from ‘future as utopia’ (as proclaimed by the futurists), to ‘no future’ (as proclaimed by punks in the 1970s), and finally to ‘future as a predicted inevitability’.11 The disappearance of the future meant the deterioration of a whole mode of social imagination: the capacity to conceive of a world radically different from the one in which we currently live”.12



Since the beginning of the 1980s, after the defeat of the working class movements and the affirmation of neoliberal ideology, the idea that we should be entrepreneurs has gained social recognition.13 “Over the past thirty years, capitalist realism has successfully installed a ‘business ontology’, in which it is simply obvious that everything in society should be run as business”,14 including culture. The public has been replaced by the consumer, who constantly craves the new. “… the affects that predominate in late capitalism are fear and cynicism. These emotions do not inspire bold thinking or entrepreneurial leaps, they breed conformity and the cult of minimal variation, the turning out of products which very closely resemble those that are already successful.15 A simulation of innovation and newness creates a state of stasis rather than the atmosphere that could allow anything genuinely new to emerge. The inability to believe in the future, permanent structural instability, the cancellation of the long term, lead invariably to stagnation and conservatism, not innovation.



4 Luxury built on ruins. Hauntology



I want to touch upon how the inability to imagine a different future affects the current cultural condition and the role design and art play in the process of creative destruction.



The failure of the future leads to hauntology, a condition of the reoccurrence of the past in the present. It is a philosophical concept introduced by Jacques Derrida in his 1993 book “Spectres of Marx”, which refers to the persistence of elements of the past, in the manner of ghosts. Mark Fisher also wrote about hauntology in relation to the condition of cultural stagnation which is persistent in the current cultural moment. He describes two directions of hauntology: a “fatal pattern'' which is bound to repeat itself and a pattern which has not yet happened, but is already shaping the current behaviour. The power of capitalism to subsume and consume all of previous history and assign all cultural objects monetary value creates a ground for historical and cultural spectres to inhabit. It also allows ruins to be turned into luxury. And when luxury is built on ruins, hauntology will inevitably reveal itself in the form of the spectres of the past.16



Design often has a role to play in this transition, enabling the conversion of ruins into luxury, becoming a link between the past and the future (sometimes erasing the past, selectively referring to it and building in it to create a wishful image to project into the future). Like in the example of Het Hem, rebranding can be used as a magical tool to transform ruins into capital. It can serve as a form of perception management, mediation of symbolic fiction. In the current form of semio-capitalism, where the semiotic character of commodities and the economic production of sign-information is tightly interwoven with processes of linguistic exchange,17 the role of design is essential. Design also takes part in the process of perpetual innovation, generating a thirst for newness and developing trends which drive consumption. Design as an industry is often rightfully considered to be a force for good, a medium for creative production and improvement. But can socially and politically engaged design projects provide economic security without having to work inside the constraints and pressures of the market? Does it have a potential to imagine a different future, innovation beyond eco capitalism and green warfare? Can it, as Nick Srnicek suggests in his work ‘Navigating Neoliberalism’, by mapping and discerning the complexity of current economic systems, help in the construction of alternative ones?18

“Modern art, due to its preoccupation with innovation, was often considered a source of social and cultural critique, an ally of social movements resisting the domination of tradition and a source for imagination of the future. The ‘shock of the new’, as Australian art critic Robert Hughes later called it, became the primary characteristic of modern art, the first as well as the final criterion for its valuation.”19 And while one might say that contemporary art has lost its ability to shock, it is still often required to be innovative, which can create short-lasting trends, cultural fads, that allow limited time and space for reflection. According to Harmut Rosa, “art has a potential to be an ‘oasis’ for resonance in our ever accelerating world, a sphere where we can explore different ways of being in the world and relating to the world”.20 Today with the growing distrust in the future and a positive nature of innovation, can contemporary art still be a source of social and cultural critique and a place to imagine an alternative future? Can it resist the ever-growing influence of the creative and culture industries, where innovation is continuously hailed as the primary source of profit?



5 Creative industry (the role of cultural agents in the neoliberal machine)



What is the difference between culture and creative industry? And what is the role of the ‘creative class’ in the capitalist economy?



Today creative industries have become to be seen increasingly important for economic well-being. Creativity has become the lifeblood (driving force) of economy, a critical paradigm of economic growth, an indispensable part of innovation and entrepreneurship. Creative industry is used to convert culture and history into assets, and cultural institutions are often used to stimulate tourism and foreign investment, as well as to manage the perception of cities and nations. And the only limit to creativity as part of the creative industry is not the imagination, but its value and profitability.



The transformative potential of creative and artistic energy as an economic motor was recognised as a political tool in the post-industrial economies. Artists and other creatives were some of the first to occupy post-industrial areas and buildings in the 1950s and 1960s, eventually transforming the undervalued urban space into highly valuable real estate. In her article ‘Culture Class: Art, Creativity, Urbanism’ Martha Rosler explores the role of culture in postwar capitalism, and the role of ‘creative class’ in reshaping economies in cities, regions, and societies. She writes that “by the 1970s, art suggested a new platform to politicians who are tired of dealing with urban poverty”.21 In her book “Loft Living: Culture and Capital in Urban Change”, published in 1982, urban sociologist Sharon Zukin lays out a theory of urban change in which artists and the entire visual art sector are a main engine for the repurposing of the post-industrial city and the renegotiation of real estate for the benefit of elites. Zukin writes: “Seeking inspiration in loft living, the new strategy of urban revitalisation aims for the less problematic sort of integration than cities have recently known. It aspires to a synthesis of art and industry, or culture and capital, in which diversity is acknowledged, controlled, and even harnessed. \[But] first, the apparent reconquest of the urban core for the middle class actually reconquers it for upper-class users. … the revitalisation projects that claim distinctiveness—because of specific historic or aesthetic traits—become a parody of the unique.”22



The concepts of the ‘creative industry’ and ‘creative city’ started to be discussed as policies, and cultural resources to be viewed as raw materials, with creativity as a method to exploit and multiply them. The term ‘creative class’ was introduced by R. Florida, in his work “The Rise of the Creative Class” from 2002, where he describes the creative class as a magnet for innovation and cutting-edge industries, and human creativity as ‘the ultimate economic resource’.23 He states that the future economy will be powered by the ‘creative class’, and cities and countries must leap to the forefront of innovation by providing what this new class desires most: the production and consumption of culture.24



As a result of this process of neatening up and pacification of the city, the ‘unruly populations’ are replaced by artists, whose critical and disruptive potential has also been neutralised in the process. “As Luc Boltanski and Ève Chiapello persuasively demonstrated in The New Spirit of Capitalism (1999/2005), Capital was able, they showed, to neutralize the subversive potential of the aesthetic strategies and ethos of the counterculture—the search for authenticity, the ideal of self-management, and the antihierarchical imperative—transforming them from instruments of liberation into new forms of control that would ultimately replace the disciplinary framework of the Fordist period.”25 Capitalism has a preternatural ability to absorb and convert critique, to neutralise it by the way of commodifying and bringing it to the mainstream. “Drawing on an advertising and technology industry that scours the social world for images, movements, and experiences yet to be commercialized, capitalism’s “creative” edge leaches any semblance that these could be utilized to create alternative social worlds. Any movement (be it a countercultural group, protest movement, meme, or activist ideology) that is looking to destabilize capitalism is viewed as a potential market to exploit.26



6 Collective consciousness / General intellect



The development of fixed capital indicates to what degree general social knowledge has become a direct force of production, and to what degree, hence, the conditions of the process of social life itself have come under the control of the general intellect and been transformed in accordance with it. (K. Marx, Grundrisse, 1858)



“Cognitive capitalism emerges in the form of a parasite: it subjects social knowledge and inhibits its emancipatory potential” (Pasquinelli 2008: 93).



The notion of ‘general intellect’ as a combination of technological expertise and social intellect (general social knowledge) was described by Marx in his Grundrisse (a series of seven notebooks). He emphasised the growing economic role of knowledge and science, as well as the role of social cooperation, that is “the growing role of the general machinery of social relations beyond the factory system.”27



By appealing to individualism, neoliberalism has destroyed the agency of community and class consciousness as well as the infrastructure that allowed it to exist. Only for a short period in the 20th century some limits to the natural violence of capitalist dynamics were legally established as a result of political pressure of unions and workers. With the decline in the political force of the workers’ movement, the natural precariousness of labor relations in capitalism and its brutality have reemerged in the form of deliberately organised loneliness, isolation of workers and competition. The current state of semio-capitalism is characterised by the growing “fractualisation of labour into separate fragments of human time, energy and intelligence to be exploited”.28 The labour force—the general intellect—has become fractulised, “unable to recognize itself as a community of sensible and sensitive beings who share the same social interests and the same cultural expectations.”29 Capital becomes the generalized semiotic flux that runs through the veins of the global economy, while labor becomes the constant activation of the intelligence of countless semiotic agents linked to one another.30 In “After the Future” Franco Bifo Berardi describes the transformation of workers into a cognitariat, or cognitive proletariat, and links the inability of the labour force to create a space of autonomy and react to the growing exploitation to the lack of spacial proximity of the bodies of labour and an existential temporal continuity (which are the effects of the precarization of labour.) Precarity refers not only to the deregulation of the labor market and the fragmentation of work, but also the dissolution of community.31 He sees the liberating potential of the self-organization of collective knowledge, if the cognitive workers find a way to overcome the fractalization of their life and intelligence.32



As opposed to the sense of inevitability and constriction of the social and political imagination that Mark Fisher described in “Capitalist Realism”, in his unfinished work “Acid Communism”, he talks about the ways of breaking that reality and changing the structural constraints of society by raising and expanding consciousness. “Consciousness raising opens up the possibility of living, not merely theorising about, a collective perspective. It can give us the resources to behave, think and act differently… The roots of any successful struggle will come from people sharing their feelings, especially their feelings of misery and desperation, and together attributing the sources of these feelings to impersonal structures.”33 In “After the Future” Franco Bifo Berardi also speaks about the potential for a different future that lies in the realisation of the power of the general intellect through raising its consciousness: “Creating a form of self-consciousness of the general intellect is the political task of the future. And it is not only political, but philosophical, epistemological, and in the end therapeutic… As the cognitariat reconnect with their bodies and collectivities and cast off the shackles of self-entrepreneurship, then song, poetry, and therapy freely mix into a cocktail that clears the head of any further illusions of the future.”34



7 Collaborative survival



I think that it is possible only if we start from exhaustion, if we emphasise the creative side of withdrawal. The exchange between life and money could be deserted, and exhaustion could give way to a huge wave of withdrawal from the sphere of economic exchange. A new refrain could emerge in that moment, and wipe out the law of economic growth. The self-organization of the general intellect could abandon the law of accumulation and growth, and start a new concatenation, where collective intelligence is only subjected to the common good. (AfF)



The long, dark night of the end of history has to be grasped as an enormous opportunity. The very oppressive pervasiveness of capitalist realism means that even glimmers of alternative political and economic possibilities can have a disproportionately great effect. The tiniest event can tear a hole in the grey curtain of reaction which has marked the horizons of possibility under capitalist realism. From a situation in which nothing can happen, suddenly anything is possible again. (CR)



There is a fine line between acknowledging the extent and seriousness of the troubles and succumbing to abstract futurism and its affects of sublime despair and its politics of sublime indifference. This book argues and tries to perform that, eschewing futurism, staying with the trouble is both more serious and more lively. (D. Haraway)



“If a rush of troubled stories is the best way to tell contaminated diversity, then it’s time to make that rush part of our knowledge practices . . . It is in listening to that cacophony of troubled stories that we might encounter our best hopes for precarious survival. (A. Tsing)



Capitalism has a supernatural ability to circumvent and absorb critique. There is a constant danger of becoming what one is actively trying to resist. As Hans-Christian Dany describes it: “Protest reinforces the system’s basic design on a structural level by informing the system of weak points via feedback loops, whereupon the system fine-tunes itself as designed”.35 Is the new space of activism in claiming the present, in slowing down and rejecting progress, productivity and competition? Would a radical passivity “threaten the ethos of relentless productivity that neoliberal politics has imposed”?36 How can the emancipatory potential of social knowledge be liberated? And how can the social energies be mobilised for the imagination of a different future? Is there a way out of this cycle of creative destruction? Can collaborative survival become an alternative to the progressive future?



In her recent book “The Force of Nonviolence. The Ethical in the Political”, Judith Butler talks about the power of nonviolence as a tactic to achieve a state of ‘radical equality’ against the ‘death drive’ that lies in the heart of the capitalist machine. Through the critique of individualism as a basis of ethics and politics alike, she suggests that if “we were to rethink ourselves as social creatures who are fundamentally dependent upon one another… we would treat each other differently, because our very conception of self would not be defined by individual self-interest”.37 There is an ‘ethical obligation’ for counter-realism, through radical hope and aspiration, as there can be no change without radical imagination to challenge what is ‘realistic’.



During the time of our research at Het Hem we were aware of the complexities of the project and our ambiguous role in it. We knew about the risk of being involved in a sophisticated form of (un)intentional art washing of the violent history and neoliberal takeover under the guise of cultural critique in the process of building luxury on ruins. We asked ourselves about the role of cultural agents in this process, ways of dealing with complex histories, a space for activism and forms of resistance in the context of an art institution, but also about collaborative survival in the ‘ruins’ of history. We questioned the nature of the alliance between capital and culture, between the real estate sector and art.



Although the art world often becomes a tool for political and economic shifts and gains, we hope that it still has the potential to be a place of experimentation, a territory that might open up possibilities, a place for storytelling as a way of resistance against dehumanisation, a place to challenge the ‘realistic’, a place for radical reimagination of ourselves as creatures not only dependant on each other, but also on other forms of life around.



‘Culture happens in communities’ is the slogan of Het Hem. But being disconnected from its immediate surroundings and history, creates the danger of staying on the surface and being taken by the flows of trends, and being under the pressure of competition and profit, makes one more vulnerable to the creative destruction of capital.



During the process of our research we realised the depth and complexity of the history of this terrain. It became clear to us that the future planned for Het Hem wouldn’t allow a place for this history to exist and be dealt with. There is a need to continue to uncover other parts of its story and its impact on the local communities and places of its resonance around the world. There is a necessity to provide a place for the voices that can tell these stories and reflect on their impacts, as a place for the community’s collective memory and for the radical imagination of a different future.



The story of Hembrug terrain is one of many examples of places with congested and violent histories. These histories continue to impact the present and the future, unless we can find a way to tell them. Storytelling and collectivity can be a way of resistance to violence, progress, profit and individualism, a way of radical imagination for a collective survival. Perhaps the way forward is by looking around, gathering together, staying with the trouble, telling stories, embracing the unknown, claiming the present to be allowed a different future.

Contemporary capitalism can be defined as semiocapitalism because the general shape of commodities has a semiotic character and the process of production is increasingly the elaboration of sign-information. In the sphere of semiocapital, economic production is increasingly tightly interwoven with processes of linguistic exchange, as is explained clearly in the books of Christian Marazzi and Paulo Virno.

“This is where an aesthetics of the interface makes a key intervention. The modernist image of a progressive future was premised on both the capacity to extrapolate and forecast the future, as well as the belief in the human capacity to manipulate the direction of history.14 We’ve now converged on a widespread acceptance of the neoliberal premise that the world is too complex to ever plan, manipulate, accelerate, modify, or otherwise intervene in. Common sense therefore has it that the market is the best we can hope for. There is no way to manipulate a complex system, so why bother? Common sense has become lost in the complexity of the world without a cognitive map to navigate it.”

Florida’s creative class includes a “broad group of creative professionals in business and finance, law, health care and related fields,” who “engage in complex problem solving that involves a great deal of independent judgment and requires high levels of education or human capital.” Within it there is a “super-creative core \[of] people in science and engineering, architecture and design, education, arts, music, and entertainment … \[whose] job is to create new ideas, new technology and/or new creative content.” (footnote 6) The vast amount of whom do not command big incomes and are eventually displaced from the neighbourhoods they helped to gentrify. (its urban development focus will price out the very creatives on whose labour it depends.) Later, in his 2017 book The New Urban Crisis, Florida retracted some of his earlier pronouncements, admitting his realisation that young artists and creatives become levers in a larger game of creeping class war”.

They might start by carving the interior walls of a chrysalis.



The shell would bear a body entangled in a process of becoming. A figure that hangs in-between. A boundary object. Neither self nor other.



Immersed in a deep sleep, they are neither alive nor dead. On the chrysalis’ walls, their vanishing words.



These words are being absorbed by the transformation they are trying to witness. Once the butterfly opens her wings, casing and inscriptions will refer to something that is already extinct, but with-held in the materiality of the new being (as vital memory). The rest of the material will turn into wind, dispersing as ashes of a fire that has already left.



The uncertainty of becoming is frightening to those in power.



Institutions, like the ones that inhabit and have inhabited this building, rely on certainty to survive. They build concrete pillars, walls, and factory floors, and lament that their permanent structures immediately begin to erode.



By seeing the world as moving in one direction only — forward — institutions forget nature’s cycles, the push and pull, the inevitability of growth, change, repercussions. These are only constant, and yet everything constructed by those in power and to promote the longevity of power fights with nature to remain, impossibly, concrete forever.



The promise of linearity is full of capitalistic hubris.



Workers rely on institutions to provide safety and security in exchange for labor, but they must also pay an opaque price. Is the feeling that they receive in return one of comfort or oppression? What secrets must they keep to put pride in their labor while their management gets rich off of murderous product? Like a bodily weight that helps you sleep at night, the institution is always there.



Like the hedera helix, they invaded a space of power and attempted to mirror a natural program of resourcefulness, resilience, and strength, made stronger by the acceptance of vulnerability and change. In the attempt to describe an experiment in presence, a process in continuous transition, their words needed to be as free and movable as possible, ready to change their physical state according to the stories they will, in turn, animate.



They begin by envisioning a polyphony composed with different channels of recorded history.



As new elements introduced in an already inhabited space, they would need to make acquaintance with spirits. Genii loci were guardians of houses during ancient roman times and they required to be revered by new occupants. By invoking them to ask for their protection, it was important to address them acknowledging their gender-free nature. In fact, they were neither masculine nor feminine. They will need the help of these ethereal voices.



But they would not focus only on material and spiritual traces in a space, they also sought to listen carefully to human testimonies, seeking alliances with the people nearby or used to work in the factory. Concerning the group’s relation with the public, which includes visitors from close and far, they sought to interrelate with them as both witnesses and research collaborators, storytellers, and listeners. Material involvement can build a caring public, so they knew to encourage participation in the process of sewing stories’ textures together.



Through recalling, creating, and exchanging narratives, I also sense the beginning of a journey to know each other honestly, to use their own relations as lenses into reflections of traumas and nuanced histories of this place. As they subject their environment to an open process of change, how might they expect to be changed with it?



As their motto suggests (“…look around rather then ahead”), their research will only marginally follow official narratives and will instead focus on sideways, on places, objects, and entities that have been somehow forgotten or overseen by the neo-liberal run within “progress”.



This progress has produced countless ruins. Their proposed refuge from and with those ruins, might become a place in which we, viewers, and I, a spectator, could be surprised by unexpected encounters and entanglements. What might emerge from waste and desolation? As Anna Tsing points out, “in a global state of precarity, we don´t have choices other than looking for life in these ruins”. Their questions about collaborative survival, about how to live in a damaged place, which is both “an act of desperation and faith” reflect a commitment to search for the true traces of violence and injustice, as well as for reflections of beauty.



Above all, it is clear in their bright faces that they seek to create and to heal.



Will they find pathways of collective recovery? In a way they are politicizing depression, which is not only a personal affliction, but also an understandable reaction to systems that affect our world’s survival. They must avoid the healing practices of fake positivity promoted for neoliberal comfort, where taking care of oneself means pacifying oneself to become more exploitable by the system.



Healing for them is not only human, but also spatial, natural, cultural and material. It is always a partial healing, a healing in process and not a state of arrival. Along this path, spectral sounds, words, and presences, may be instruments through which to tell stories of both loss and resurgence.



Inspired by Anna Tsing’s studies and explorations of the Oregon forest, they will delve into the forest which surrounds the Het Hem site, the shokbos, kleibos, or plofjesbos, trying to connect with its living-space webs. What do the plants and other organisms say? What do they do? What is their relationship with time here?



They seek to understand the agency of those beings among the assemblages in which they are immersed. But will they reach a distributive agency? How will they learn from these many beings about human moral responsibility, about affection, without a lens of anthropocentrism? How will they mirror and engage with or give space to the truths emerging from the livelihoods rooted in local soil?



Their research will involve investigations within a material workplace, which will be situated inside Het HEM. This space became something else at the very moment of the group’s first encounter. They now create a modular, elastic structure, informal architecture that is assembled and reassembled every time they meet. They will need to create shifting platforms for presentations, discussions and action. They will need to be nomadic within the building and without any leader. By the end, will they want their space to be divided by walls? What will they learn about the porosity of borders, between persons, intellects, social strata, political beliefs? What will it look like to see interconnectedness in a physical space?



My vanishing words end, for now, with their research-process beginning. It moves towards something that goes beyond them and is closer to a sound, an intersection of voices, a mixed choir, scattered screams, animal howls, a hiss, confusing cracklings, or just silence.

<!--StartFragment-->

On the 9th of September I got on a flight from Venice to Amsterdam to get to the Hembrug terrain some days before the beginning of the project. Nico and Pantxo were already there since a couple of weeks, working on the tunnel piece, which would have opened our Chapter.



When I got to the het Hem building, which I had seen for the first time in June when we had the second meeting with the group, it did not feel familiar. Nico was waiting for me at the entrance. He looked tired. He was covered in dust. He took me inside the apartment in which we would have lived for the next four months. Pantxo came upstairs to say hello, and then Nico and him went back to work in the tunnel, which was two floors underneath our feet.



The apartment was quite empty and neutral, an open space organised into two floors. The windows occupied a whole wall in the upper floor, where there was a kitchen, a big dining table and some shelfs on which Nico had already arranged his books. A thick door led to the bedroom, which was a sound-proof black box. The Noordzeekanaal flanked the building and occupied most of the view from the windows, establishing the colour of the interior space. Beyond the canal, chimneys, shipyards and other industrial buildings shaped the landscape.



There was an empty green table next to the window, on the right corner of the room. I unpacked some books from my suitcase and arranged them on the table. One of them was Poetics of Relation by Edouard Glissant. I took my laptop, I sat down and opened a new blank file. I looked away, towards the canal.



Ships were passing by. From one corner of the window to the other. Massive cargo ships crossed the range of my sight. Smaller boats were passing too, following at lower speed the wake of the bigger ships. The room was invaded with sounds and vibrations of different depths.



Where do these ships come from?

Where do they go?

What do they carry?

For some ships the material they were transporting was visible: heaps of coal, sand, trash. For others, the cargo was hidden inside their bellies. I started imagining similar ships passing by in other times. What did these ships carry in the early times of the bullet factory?



The Nordseekanal was constructed between 1865 and 1876 to enable seafaring vessels to reach the port of Amsterdam. The canal was involved very soon in the transatlantic slave route, connecting the port of Amsterdam with the African coasts and the Americas. It all started in the 17 century, when the Netherlands began to acquire wealth and profit through the exploitation of their colonies in North and South America. The Dutch economy prospered from the triangle of trade over the course of two centuries. Ships left the Dutch harbours for West Africa loaded with weapons, ammunition, liquor and textiles. This merchandise was used to buy slaves, who in turn were sold in the New World. The ships then returned to the Netherlands with sugar, coffee, cotton, cocoa or tobacco from the plantations. Products from the New World would take the place of human bodies in the ships´ bellies for the wealth of Dutch citizens.



I opened Edouard Glissant´s book and read the first chapter titled “The Open Boat”. He describes the womb of the boat in which slaves were crammed into during the time of the slave-trade. Those wombs bear the abyss of the unknown, he writes. He describes the unknown as tree folded: the unknown of the moving cage that the ship represented. The unknown depth of the sea. And the unknown future, once the ship would touch the shores of an unknown land on the other side of the ocean.



—add quote—



I looked back at the ships passing by.

They are still following the spectral wake of those old ships that preceded them. They are still following the same routes, commercial routes, colonial routes, routes of violence and forgotten responsibility, routes that entangle privilege and pain. A never-ending movement strives towards the abyss of exploitation, of violence and death.



Almost all the money that financed slave plantations in Suriname and the Antilles came from bankers in Amsterdam, just as many of the ships used to transport slaves were built there. Revenue from the goods produced with slave labor funded much of The Netherlands’ Golden Age in the 17th century, a period renowned for its artistic, literary, scientific, and philosophical achievements (add reference).



I followed the ships´coming and going for a few hours. At some point it started raining. The view on the ships became opaque. I could only hear their sound. I could only feel the building trembling when they would pass.

Ships keep on passing by, while we don’t see them…



The following day I woke up early. The light was beautiful. I noticed how light fell on the water of the canal and reflected onto the ceiling, trembling with warped undulations when ships would cross the waters. I started noticing that each ship had a name. I started focusing on each name.



Spectre, Expedition, Sea falcon, Jolien, Morgane, Rosalie… (hand written)



I took my little black notebook with removable sheets I still hadn’t used, and started writing down the names of the ships that were crossing the canal. I wrote 10 names.



Virgo, Seabass, Fortuna, Endurance, Conqueror, Hendrikje, Expedition, Stranger, Conquest, For-Ever...



I started seeing those names as the only still visible records of the ships that were delivering violence through these water ways in the past.

In the meantime, I started researching about ships´ names. I was curious to understand more about the process of naming in which ships were involved. Apparently, every time a new boat is ready to sail, its owners organise a ritual on the boat in which the boat receives its baptism. During the ceremony, which usually takes place on the slipway in the shipbuilder’s yard, the vessel´s godmother smashes a champagne bottle on the bow of the ship and toast together in honour of the new ship. After that, the name of the ship is revealed. Ship-naming is a ritual for the gods of the sea to protect vessels while plowing the waters.

Sailors have always created strong connections with the vessel they were relying on during their ocean-crossing. They have always anthropomorphised their ships, in order to feel closer to them. Naming things gives them a continuity and an integrity across time and space. To give name to a ship is not only a spiritual practice but also a gesture of recognition for the ship to be a companion to share a dangerous journey with.



Writing the names of the ships that pass by, today, might be an ulterior process of recognition. It means to read their presence. To read the messages they carry, the stories hidden within their names. To make them visible means to unravel the unspoken history of this canal and of many water ways that are not visible from this window.



A list of names would keep memories from disappearing…



Looking into the records of ship names, I discovered that ship names are mostly women’s names. For centuries, women were not allowed to travel on commercial ships. To have a woman on board was considered bad luck. But the naming ceremony was carried out by a godmother. Women names were painted on the bow of ships. Also, female mythological figures made of wood or other resistant materials were often put on the bow of ships, as spiritual protection. The spiritual, abstract role of women was accepted on a ship. Only actual women could not step on their deck.

One morning Nico noticed the little sheets of paper with the ship names spread on my green desk and he asked me what they were. I was sitting by the kitchen table, reading and keeping an eye to the names of the ships passing, quickly noting them down onto new sheets. I explained him what I had started doing. He liked my new activity and he offered to help. We spent the morning recording the ships´ passage together.

The afternoon of the second day we spent with the group, the day in which we spoke with the former workers, we went to sit all together in a small room in the upper floor of the building, from which the ships were very visible. For the first time, we talked about the export of the ammunitions that were produced in the building. How and whereto were the bullets transported? To which governments were they sold? To sustain which conflict? To suppress which uprising? Some workers had mentioned sales to Israel, Turkey, Mozambique, South Africa, Indonesia, but they had been very vague about it. We realised that most of ammunitions had been probably transported through the water ways, through the canal in front of the building, where all these ships were still passing by today. 



We set out to start researching in order to trace the movements of the bullets produced in the factory. The movement of the bullets from the factory to the outside world flowing through the water ways. I told the group about my list of ship names.



That evening some people of the group stayed in Hembrug and sat outside the building with some drinks, right in front of the canal. I was in the apartment with Nico, it was my birthday and he had cooked Maklube, one of my favorite dishes. At some point, Simon sent me a picture of a ship passing by the canal. The ship´ s name was …(?).

From that moment on, everyone in the group started sending pictures of the ships by the canal, documenting their name and thus their passage. The list I had started turned into a collectively assembled photographic archive.



Mirror, Reality, …..



One night some weeks after I had started looking at the ships Nico was testing the parabolas on the upper floor of the building. The building was empty except from the two of us. I entered the huge room that was in complete darkness. The only light came from the intermittent red or blue signals of the ships passing by. They created beautiful reflections on the columns. The parabolas were on and they were turning, emitting the sounds Nico was producing, but their lights were off. I sat next to him and listened, looking at the shapes of the ships crossing the canal, their vibrations mixing with the sounds of the parabolas.



a sea voyage

from one corner of the room to the other

light refracting

on the ceiling of the bullet factory

ships pass by and we don’t see them

their names,

aligned letter

on the edge of water

too fast to make sense

streaming

as news´ tickers

already opaque, forgotten.



we should read these names out loud,

i thought.

the ships´ names

crossing our throats

floating in our mouths

voices at the edge of water

naming the unknown



the echoes of the past

in the present of these names



low voices resonating together

inside this building

and elsewhere

always here,

and there.

The piece that developed from this idea was named Infinite Responsibility and it showed 90 postcards with pictures of ships that we took with our phones during the entire residency period. On the back of the postcards were written all the illegal and secret transactions that flowed out of the factory and Eurometaal, the company that owned it. In total, we found more than 50 conflicts around the world that had received arms and bullets that were either tested or fabricated on Hembrug terrain and left it through the water ways.



The postcards swayed gently as people walked past them and their shadows formed complex patterns on the concrete ground.

The ships´ ‘movements’ appear as messages in the back of the postcards.



Expedition, Stranger, Conquest, For-Ever...



The echoes from the past are still hiding. In blurring the past and present, we see the here as there and the there as here,



always here, wherever one is and wherever one looks, closest to home. Infinite responsibility therefore, no rest allowed for any form of good conscience. (Derrida, Dedication to Chris Hani, Specters of Marx).

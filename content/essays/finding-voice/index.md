Today changed me somehow. Rolando Hernandez did a sonic meditation with us. I had never done one before but it felt familiar. It felt like something I had always wished for but never known to ask. It was sort of cathartic. Like actually meditating while discovering new feelings and new freedom. I feel freer than I’ve ever felt.

I used my voice so much today and I love it. I’ve undervalued how important my voice is to me when in fact it’s essential. My voice brings up conflicting feelings from childhood. My dad loved my singing, but I didn’t want to please him, so I kept it to myself. I felt like singing or being loud was offending someone, like I already knew it would hurt someone’s feelings. Why couldn’t I be free as a child? Why couldn’t I just be myself? Of course these questions don’t need answers, but today they’re new and I guess that’s worth something.

I want to be a better activist. I like to speak. I don’t think I’ve ever acknowledged that, that I like to speak. I am using my voice while still finding it.

Improvising with others is the most beautiful thing in the world. Human creativity is both animal and mechanical but also magical and spiritually essential. I am so privileged to be in this group. I feel we are creating something new. I know nothing is “new new” but it’s new in that it’s in this place with these people, at this time in history. Maybe it isn’t new. Or who cares. I love it.

I will be a different person after these three months. I don’t want to forget about my voice. I’ve never achieved the strength and clarity that I did today. I don’t want to lose this freedom.

I have this recurring feeling that I’ve been preparing for this group my entire life without knowing it.

The story of Het HEM is told in the language of humans (people, production, movement). In this era of human-induced ecological crisis known as the Anthropocene, it is necessary to listen to non-humans as well. Both in the present and in the past, to gain a more comprehensive view of our impact on the planet.

\[edit the above perhaps]



\[header; Creation of the Hembrug terrain and the Shock Forest]

In the three decades preceding the First World War the Dutch constructed the ‘Stelling van Amsterdam’. A defensive military stronghold to protect the capital and its adjacent regions from invasion, shielding important civil, industrial and military services. Inundation of the surrounding lands would keep the enemy at bay and the facilities within ‘De Stelling’ would sustain the stronghold up to six months. An important asset to harbour inside was a weapons- and ammunitions factory. And so, a natural body of water (‘de Holle Sloot’) was drained to artificially extend the tongue of land De Hem alongside the Noordzeekanaal. This new land became the Hembrug terrain where Artillerie Inrichtingen (AI) settled between 1895-1900 to produce and test military equipment. On the man-made soil of peat, clay and sand a forest was planted as an integral part of the terrain. ‘The Shock Forest’ acted as a sonic and visual camouflage for its military factories. A protective barrier for incoming and outgoing dangers. Over time, the factory grew, supplied operations of the Dutch military and exported their products to foreign powers, both legally and illegally. AI, later called Eurometaal, also became a significant part of the local community.

In 2003, Eurometaal closed. Due to efforts by former workers, the remaining buildings and part of the shock forest received (‘industrial’) monumental status. Many of these buildings are now exploited for commercial purposes. In one of them Het HEM resides, a house for modern art and culture. The shock forest remained closed off for visitors up until 2020 because of soil contamination by industrial activities. Remediation of the soil is now said to be complete. During this process more than 700 trees had to be taken down. It is clear that even though the factory closed in 2003, it left an unavoidable mark on the landscape.



The monumental status of the shock forest is based upon it being a structural and functional part of the factory, the Hembrug terrain and Stelling van Amsterdam. It was designed for a specific purpose in this context and so gained cultural, military, architectural and historical value. So very human. The monumental status grants the trees in the forest a certain form of protection. Cutting them down now also means destroying a monument. In remediating the soil more care is taken by sucking up and replacing the soil underneath a tree instead of uprooting it. When this is not possible a tree is struck down, but a new, similar individual is planted further in the forest. These extra measures are not taken for all trees in the shock forest but only for those that were part of the original forest design. Subsequently developed vegetation is not deemed to have their value. So what is actually protected is not the trees, not the forest but the human design. The living beings that make up the forest are of less value than the objectified ‘trees’ that were specified in the original planting scheme. A monument born from deeply anthropocentric views.

The anthropocentric thinking behind this denomination of monumental status implies a hierarchy where human efforts and needs are put above those of non-humans. Simultaneously, it appears as if these two entity groups are separate and functioning irrespective of each other. The result is that non-humans are used (often heedless) to the will of humans. This perspective on the story of the shock forest monument is a metonymy for the way ‘nature’ is being treated by so much humans worldwide. The trees in the shock forest are surprisingly granted a strange form of protection because of it. Unfortunately, countless plants and animals and so many entire species have not had this luck giving way to human needs.

This, in the end, destructive way of thinking may have some grounding in several important human-centred philosophies that through rationalism (or divine intervention) imply a similar hierarchy. Descartes, for example, classified animals as machines. As opposed to humans, they would not be able to rationalize, and therefore were devoid of a consciousness or soul. Demoted to objects. Even further back, (parts of) the bible presents nature as a resource made available to man, and in Greek philosophy Socrates’ learnings brought man into the centre of discussions, rather than nature where man was a part of (as pre-Socratics had it). Different observations, perspectives and beliefs in different times generate different outcomes. Scientific biological research in the past decades increasingly shows us the rational, emotional, conscious sides of more and more animals and already since Darwin we know humans are just another variety. The terms ‘rational’, ‘emotional’ and ‘conscious’ should here be regarded as qualities of particular animals and not as reflections of our human expressions of them. Growing insight in past, present and future ecosystem dynamics shows us every animal is just another link in a network consisting of plants, bacteria, fungi and viruses that intermingle in a matrix of abiotic factors. On micro- and macroscale all these links are responsive and interdependent. The lack of accepting this can apparently bring forth the image of nature as a production mechanism, a service provider consisting of non-responsive mechanical objects. The implied hierarchy and dichotomy of human and nature is an illusion.



Let’s bring this back to the Hembrug terrain. It was chosen to take more care with trees that were part of a human design than with trees that were growing there on their own. A monumentalized tree that is cut, is no longer monumental and is replaced by a new tree. So, the design has more value than the individual tree. It is a subtle expression of the illusion of human superiority. Still, when trees are planned to be taken down some local political parties and civilian movements stand up for the forest. They care about its presence. Be it from a holistic-, aesthetic-, property-value-perspective or otherwise, it promotes the forest from its factory-associated status as a functional object to something more akin to a living being. It appears the hierarchical gap is not as big for everyone.

Of the hundreds of trees that were cut to allow soil remediation, we salvaged two big trunks and placed these inside Het HEM. By translocating these decapitated individuals to our will, we were conforming to the ‘illusion’ as well. Only now the focus is on the tree, the individual. The two demonumentalised trees in this way gained a new sort of human value as ‘art pieces’. Generating human value in respect of the non-human could be a way to reduce the hierarchical distance. Also, the translocation of the trees makes them not a monument to a factory sustaining a violent past, but to one of listening and respect. The placement in the weapons and ammunition factory is even more relevant if we consider that colonialism was a part of this violent past - a past resembling the illusion of superiority and dichotomy among humans.

Accompanying the trunks there was a screen where an ‘entity’ went into conversation with the visitor. One interpretation is that the tree was given a voice. Animating, or humanizing the non-human could be a way to make people see it is just as well a link in an interdependent network of beings, worthy of our respect. Anthropomorphizing the tree, or the cognitive and affective side of animals, or the complexity of living in any organism, is again very human-centred. If this is needed however to increase respect and decrease the hierarchical distance it is not destructive. Of course, as long as it in the end does not lead to underestimation of the non-human and overestimation of the human.
